# number-nest

A basic course/student management system for tracking course enrollment, manual payments, and attendance.

## Status

`frontend/` is scaffolded (Vite + React + TypeScript) with teacher auth wired up end-to-end: `LoginPage`/`RegisterPage`/`DashboardPage`, a Zustand `authStore` holding the teacher session, and a `ProtectedRoute` gating authenticated routes. `Header` renders the app logo top-left (plus the logged-in teacher's name and a logout button) on every page. Once logged in, a `NavMenu` renders as a left sidebar (not a top bar) linking to Dashboard, Students, Courses, Enrollments, Payments, Attendance, Exams, and Notices, each link paired with an inline icon (`src/components/NavIcons.tsx`) sitting in a bordered 32px icon box (`.app-nav-icon`) that echoes the bordered icon-button style already used in every feature's list-table Action column; `App.tsx` wraps the sidebar and the routed page content in an `.app-body`/`.app-main` flex row so the two sit side by side. The whole app is responsive: below 768px the sidebar collapses into a horizontal, horizontally-scrollable top bar (`NavMenu.css`'s `@media (max-width: 768px)` block, which also switches `.app-body` to a column layout); the header wraps below 640px; every feature page's header row (`*-page-header`) wraps its action button under the title if space runs out; and `#content` (rendered by every page) is `box-sizing: border-box` with `min-width: 0` so its own padding can't push the page wider than the viewport (a real bug hit during this pass — the sidebar shrank available width enough to expose it). `DashboardPage` (route `/dashboard`) is an analytics view, not a form/list page: a course `<select>` (from `courseStore`) and a student `<select>` (populated from that course's enrolled students via `api.getCourse`, disabled until a course is picked, and reset whenever the course changes) scope everything below them. Selecting a course fetches that course's attendance (`api.getAttendance(courseId)`, no `session_date` — every session for the course), its exams (`api.getExams(courseId)`, the frontend `getExams` helper gained an optional `courseId` query param for this — the backend route already supported `course_id` filtering, unused until now), and then that course's marks per exam (`api.getMarks(examId)` fanned out over each exam with `Promise.all`, since marks have no course-level list endpoint) and renders a course-level section: an `AttendanceDonut` (present/absent share across every enrolled student's sessions) plus a `BarChart` of the average mark per exam. Picking a student on top of that adds a second, student-scoped section with the same two chart shapes — an `AttendanceDonut` of just that student's present/absent sessions, and a `BarChart` of just that student's obtained mark per exam — computed client-side by filtering the same attendance/marks payloads already fetched for the course, not a second round of requests. The two chart components (`src/components/charts/AttendanceDonut.tsx`, `BarChart.tsx`, sharing `chartMath.ts` for the niceCeil axis-rounding and conic-gradient donut math, and `charts.css`) are generic and reused across both the course-level and student-level sections. `CoursesPage` is implemented end-to-end against `app/courses/`: a Zustand `courseStore` (`fetchCourses`/`createCourse`/`updateCourse`/`deleteCourse`) backs a list table (`CourseTable`, with edit/delete icon actions), and a create/edit form (`CourseFormDialog`) that renders inside a generic `Modal` component (`src/components/Modal.tsx`) reusable by future features. Course list rows are clickable and navigate to `CourseDetailPage` (route `/courses/:id`) — a full page (not a modal) showing a read-only course card plus a table of the course's *actively* enrolled students (a discontinued enrollment drops off this roster), fetched via `GET /courses/{id}` (which now returns the enrolled student list alongside the course fields). `StudentsPage` is implemented end-to-end against `app/students/`, following the same list-table + `Modal` create/edit-form pattern as courses (`studentStore`, `StudentTable`, `StudentFormDialog`). `StudentTable` rows also carry a dedicated detail icon (`EyeIcon`, alongside the existing edit/delete icons in `StudentIcons.tsx`) that navigates to `StudentDetailPage` (route `/students/:id`) — a full page, not a modal, fetched via a new `api.getStudent(id)` helper hitting `GET /students/{id}` (the backend route already existed but had no frontend caller until now). The page renders three cards: student information (contact fields plus an inline table of the student's enrollments — course name, `start_from`, `enrollment_fee_paid`, and a read-only Active/Discontinued status derived from `discontinued_at` — resolved via `enrollmentStore`/`courseStore` lookup maps); a due-payments card computed client-side by `buildDuePayments` (`src/pages/students/studentDetailDisplay.ts`) — for each enrollment, every calendar month from its `start_from` through the current month (or, if the enrollment has a `discontinued_at`, capped at that month instead — a discontinued student stops accruing new dues, though the discontinuation month itself still counts) with no matching `Payment` record (`enrollment_id` plus the `YYYY-MM` prefix of `payment.month`) is listed as due at that course's `course_fee`, purely a client-side computation over already-fetched `enrollmentStore`/`paymentStore` data with no backend "dues" endpoint; and a payment-history card listing the student's actual `Payment` records across all enrollments, newest month first. `StudentsPage` also owns a client-side course filter bar (a single course `<select>`, filter state living in the page, not `studentStore`) that narrows the full `students` list before handing it to `StudentTable` — matching a student in if any of their `enrollmentStore` entries has the selected `course_id` (there's no `course_id` on `Student` itself, unlike enrollments/payments' filters); a "Clear filters" button appears once the filter is active, and `StudentTable` gained an optional `emptyMessage` prop (defaulting to `'No students yet.'`) so the page can distinguish that from "no students match the selected filter," same pattern as `EnrollmentTable`/`PaymentTable`. `EnrollmentsPage` is implemented end-to-end against `app/enrollments/`: a Zustand `enrollmentStore` (`fetchEnrollments`/`createEnrollment`/`updateEnrollmentFeePaid`/`deleteEnrollment` — add/delete only for the enrollment itself, matching the backend's no-edit-in-place semantics, plus a narrow update path for the fee-paid flag described below) backs a list table (`EnrollmentTable`) that resolves each enrollment's `student_id`/`course_id` to a display name via lookup maps built client-side from `studentStore`/`courseStore` (the `EnrollmentRead` schema only returns ids, not nested student/course objects); `EnrollmentFormDialog` renders in a `Modal` with student/course `<select>`s populated from those same stores, a `start_from` date input, and an "Enrollment fee paid" checkbox (defaults unchecked). `EnrollmentTable` also renders `enrollment_fee_paid` as a live checkbox per row — toggling it calls `updateEnrollmentFeePaid`, which hits `PATCH /enrollments/{id}/fee-paid`, a deliberate exception to the add/delete-only rule (see `.claude/rules/features/enrollment.md`) since delete/re-add would cascade-delete the enrollment's payment and attendance history just to flip a boolean. `EnrollmentTable` also renders `discontinued_at` as a live `<input type="date">` per row (empty = active) — changing it calls `updateEnrollmentDiscontinued`, which hits `PATCH /enrollments/{id}/discontinue`, the second such carve-out; clearing the date back to empty reactivates the enrollment rather than requiring delete/re-add (blocked anyway by the `(student_id, course_id)` unique constraint). A discontinued enrollment stays in `GET /enrollments` (so `EnrollmentsPage`/`StudentDetailPage` still see its history) but drops out of `EnrollmentRepository.list_students_for_course`, so it no longer appears on its course's enrolled-student roster. The enrollment modal is intentionally wider than the default (`Modal`'s `className` prop, added for this, plus an `.enrollment-modal` override in `enrollments.css`) since it doesn't fit `Modal`'s default 640px max-width as comfortably as the shorter course/student forms. `EnrollmentsPage` guards "Add enrollment" behind a check that at least one student and one course exist first, surfacing a client-side `ApiError` via `ErrorDialog` if not. `EnrollmentsPage` also owns a client-side filter bar (course/student `<select>`s, filter state living in the page, not a store) that narrows `enrollmentStore`'s full `enrollments` list before handing it to `EnrollmentTable` — matching directly against each enrollment's own `student_id`/`course_id` (no lookup-through-enrollment hop needed here, unlike payments below, since `Enrollment` already carries both ids directly); there's no backend query param involved, and a "Clear filters" button appears once either filter is active, same pattern as `PaymentsPage`'s filter bar. `EnrollmentTable` gained an optional `emptyMessage` prop so the page can distinguish "no enrollments yet" from "no enrollments match the selected filters," same pattern as `PaymentTable`'s. `PaymentsPage` is implemented end-to-end against `app/payments/`, following the same list-table + `Modal` create-form pattern as enrollments: a Zustand `paymentStore` (`fetchPayments`/`createPayment`/`deletePayment` — add/delete only) backs a list table (`PaymentTable`) that resolves each payment's `enrollment_id` to student/course display names via a two-hop lookup (`enrollment_id` → enrollment → `student_id`/`course_id` → name, since `PaymentRead` only returns `enrollment_id`, not nested objects); `PaymentFormDialog` has a single enrollment `<select>` (labelled `"{student} — {course}"`) plus a `month` (`<input type="month">`, converted to the first-of-month date `YYYY-MM-01` on submit), `payment_date`, and `amount` input, rendered in a `Modal`, and `PaymentsPage` guards "Add payment" behind at least one enrollment existing, same pattern as enrollments' guard. `PaymentsPage` also owns a client-side filter bar (course/student `<select>`s plus month and payment-date inputs, filter state living in the page, not a store) that narrows `paymentStore`'s full `payments` list before handing it to `PaymentTable` — course/student filters match through the same `enrollment_id` → enrollment → `student_id`/`course_id` lookup `PaymentTable` already uses, the month filter compares `payment.month`'s `YYYY-MM` prefix against the `<input type="month">` value, and the payment-date filter compares `payment.payment_date` directly; there's no backend query param involved (the `GET /payments` route only supports an `enrollment_id` filter), and a "Clear filters" button appears once any filter is active. `PaymentTable` gained an optional `emptyMessage` prop so the page can distinguish "no payments recorded yet" from "no payments match the selected filters." `AttendancePage` looks different from every other feature page, by design (see `.claude/rules/features/attendance.md`): a course `<select>` (from `courseStore`) plus a `session_date` input (defaulted to today) drive an `AttendanceSheet` — a table of that course's enrolled students (fetched via `api.getCourse`, not `courseStore`, since only `CourseDetailRead` carries the student list) with a present/absent checkbox per row, prefilled from any existing attendance for that `(course, date)` via the Zustand `attendanceStore`'s `fetchAttendance`, and submitted as one `POST /attendance/bulk` call via `submitAttendance` — resubmitting for the same date upserts rather than erroring, so the date field doubles as a way to revisit and correct a prior session. The layout is full-width and forced to a single light theme (no dark-mode media query). `ExamsPage` and `NoticesPage` are implemented end-to-end against `app/exams/` and `app/notices/` respectively, each its own standalone nav link/route (`/exams`, `/notices`) rather than living on the Dashboard — an earlier pass toward folding event creation into the Dashboard was scrapped in favor of matching every other feature's list-page pattern. Both follow the same list-table + `Modal` create-form pattern as payments/enrollments: `examStore`/`noticeStore` (`fetch*`/`create*`/`delete*` — add/delete only) back `ExamTable`/`NoticeTable`, each resolving `course_id` to a course name via a lookup map built from `courseStore`; `ExamFormDialog` has a course `<select>`, a `datetime-local` input, an optional description textarea, and an `exam_mark` number input, while `NoticeFormDialog` has `event_name`/`event_place` text inputs, a `datetime-local` input, and a course `<select>` — both guard their "Add" action behind at least one course existing, same as payments/enrollments. `ExamTable` rows are clickable (same pattern as `CourseTable`) and navigate to `ExamDetailPage` (route `/exams/:id`) — a full page showing a read-only exam card plus a `MarkSheet`: a table of that exam's course's enrolled students (fetched via `api.getCourse`, same source `AttendanceSheet` uses) with a numeric mark input per row, prefilled from any existing marks for that exam via the Zustand `markStore`'s `fetchMarks`, and submitted as one `POST /marks/bulk` call via `submitMarks` — resubmitting for the same exam upserts each student's mark rather than erroring, mirroring `AttendancePage`'s upsert-on-resubmit pattern exactly. `LandingPage` (route `/`) is the one public, unauthenticated page in the app — not wrapped in `ProtectedRoute`, rendered without the `NavMenu` sidebar; `DashboardPage` moved off `/` to a new protected route, `/dashboard`, and `NavMenu`'s "Dashboard" link plus the post-login redirect now point there instead. `NavMenu` also gained a "Landing page" link (first item, `HomeIcon`) pointing at `/`, so a logged-in teacher can navigate back to the public landing page from the sidebar. `LandingPage` is backed by a `publicStore` (`fetchPublicCourses`/`fetchPublicNotices`, hitting `app/public/`'s unauthenticated routes) and renders two read-only sections: a single horizontally-scrolling row of upcoming notice cards (`NoticeCard`, `.notice-grid` is a non-wrapping flex row, not a grid — no click-through, no detail page) with each notice's `course_id` resolved to a name via the fetched public course list, same lookup-map pattern used everywhere else; and a "Routine" section (heading before the container, mirroring "Notices") with a centered, wide "Select your course" `<select>` that, once a course is picked, renders a `RoutineTable` below it — a real HTML `<table>` (Day | Time, one row per `course_days` entry sorted into Mon→Sun order, `class_time` repeated per row since it's one time for the whole course, tight column padding) plus the course's `note` (not `course_motto`) shown bold and red below the table as a standout callout. `backend/` is scaffolded with a module per feature. `app/teacher/` is implemented: the `Teacher` and `RefreshToken` models plus register/login/refresh/logout/me auth endpoints (JWT bearer access tokens + opaque, hashed, DB-backed refresh tokens with rotation-on-use and revocation, bcrypt password hashing), split into router (HTTP)/service (business logic)/repository (data access) layers — see [Backend architecture](#backend-architecture). `app/courses/` is implemented: full CRUD (create/list/get/update/delete) on the `Course` model (fields include both `course_fee`, the recurring fee, and `enrollment_fee`, the one-time fee charged at enrollment, plus `class_time` — a required time-of-day all of `course_days` share — and `note`, an optional freeform string shown on the landing page's routine table), gated behind `get_current_teacher` on every route; `GET /courses/{id}` returns `CourseDetailRead` (course fields plus `students: StudentRead[]`, sourced via `EnrollmentRepository.list_students_for_course`, which filters to actively-enrolled students only — `discontinued_at IS NULL`). `app/students/` is implemented: full CRUD on the `Student` model. `app/enrollments/` is implemented: add/list/delete only (no edit-in-place) on the `Enrollment` join model, with a DB-level unique constraint on `(student_id, course_id)` plus a service-layer `ConflictException` guard against double-enrollment; it also carries an `enrollment_fee_paid` boolean (settable at creation, default `False`) and a `discontinued_at` nullable date (default `NULL`, not settable at creation) that can each be updated afterwards via dedicated `PATCH /enrollments/{id}/fee-paid` and `PATCH /enrollments/{id}/discontinue` routes — the two deliberate exceptions to enrollments' otherwise add/delete-only semantics, since delete/re-add would cascade-delete payment and attendance history just to flip a field. Setting `discontinued_at` marks the enrollment discontinued (excluded from `EnrollmentRepository.list_students_for_course`'s active roster, and its course's attendance/mark sheets by extension, though its own row and history are untouched); clearing it back to `NULL` reactivates the enrollment. `app/payments/` is implemented: add/list/delete only (no edit-in-place) on the `Payment` model, which hangs off `enrollment_id` (not `student_id`/`course_id` directly), with a DB-level unique constraint on `(enrollment_id, month)` plus a service-layer `ConflictException` guard against recording two payments for the same enrollment in the same month. `app/attendance/` is implemented: the `Attendance` model hangs off `enrollment_id` with a unique constraint on `(enrollment_id, session_date)`; `POST /attendance/bulk` records a whole course-session sheet at once — resolving each entry's `student_id` to its enrollment via `EnrollmentRepository.get_by_student_and_course`, then **upserting** the `(enrollment, session_date)` row (unlike every other feature's add/delete-only semantics) — and `GET /attendance` (required `course_id`, optional `session_date`) returns `AttendanceRead` enriched with a `student_id` field that isn't a column on `Attendance` itself but is joined in via `Enrollment`, so the frontend can match records back to students without a second fetch. `app/exams/` is implemented: add/list/delete only (no edit-in-place) on the `Exam` model (course_id, exam_datetime, description, exam_mark — the exam's total/full mark, not a per-student score), which hangs off `course_id` directly (not enrollment, unlike payments/attendance) since an exam belongs to the course as a whole. `app/notices/` is implemented: add/list/delete only (no edit-in-place) on the `Notice` model (course_id, event_name, event_place, event_datetime), same course_id-direct relationship as exams. `app/marks/` is implemented: the `Mark` model hangs off both `enrollment_id` and `exam_id` with a unique constraint on `(enrollment_id, exam_id)`; `POST /marks/bulk` records a whole exam's mark sheet at once — resolving each entry's `student_id` to its enrollment via `EnrollmentRepository.get_by_student_and_course` (using the exam's `course_id`), then **upserting** the `(enrollment, exam)` row, exactly like `app/attendance/`'s bulk upsert — and `GET /marks?exam_id=` returns `MarkRead` enriched with a `student_id` field joined in via `Enrollment`, same technique attendance uses. `GET /exams/{id}` (added alongside marks) returns a single `ExamRead`, backing `ExamDetailPage`'s fetch. `app/public/` is implemented: the one router in the app with **no** `get_current_teacher` dependency, backing `LandingPage`. Rather than a new model/schema layer, its `PublicService` wraps `CourseRepository` and `NoticeRepository` directly (the same repositories `app/courses/` and `app/notices/` already use) and reuses their `CourseRead`/`NoticeRead` response schemas unchanged — `GET /public/courses` returns every course unfiltered, `GET /public/notices` returns only upcoming ones (`event_datetime >= now`, ascending) via a new `NoticeRepository.list_upcoming` method. Shared infra (`Settings`, DB engine/session, the `get_current_teacher` auth dependency and `BearerAuth` bearer-scheme wrapper, the `AppException` family + handler) lives in `app/core/`. All models use UUID (not integer) primary keys. Alembic migrations run against a Supabase Postgres project over the transaction pooler. This file documents the intended stack and feature scope so implementation stays consistent as it's built out.

## Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.14, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (async) + `asyncpg`, Alembic for migrations, JWT (`pyjwt`) + `bcrypt` for teacher auth
- **Frontend**: Node 24, React (Vite), TypeScript, Zustand for state management
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase, connected through the transaction pooler (port 6543) — requires `statement_cache_size=0` in `connect_args` (both in `app/core/database.py` and `migrations/env.py`) since pgbouncer transaction mode doesn't support asyncpg's server-side prepared statements
- **Primary keys**: every table uses a UUID primary key (`Mapped[uuid.UUID]`, Python-side `default=uuid.uuid4`, DB-side `server_default=gen_random_uuid()` — requires the `pgcrypto` extension, created via migration), not an integer/serial id
- **Payments**: manual/offline tracking only — no payment gateway integration

## Backend architecture

Each feature module follows a layered structure — routers stay thin, business logic and data access are separated so each module is testable independently:

- **`router.py`** — HTTP layer only. Parses the request via Pydantic schemas, calls the service through a FastAPI `Depends`, returns the result. No query logic or business rules.
- **`service.py`** — business logic (e.g. "registration is closed once a teacher exists", password verification, token issuance). Takes a repository instance, raises `app.core.exceptions.AppException` subclasses on domain errors. Exposes a `get_<name>_service` FastAPI dependency that wires up the repository from `get_db`.
- **`repository.py`** — data access only. Wraps the `AsyncSession` and exposes query/mutation methods (`get_by_id`, `get_by_email`, `create`, ...). No business rules here.
- **`models.py` / `schemas.py`** — SQLAlchemy models and Pydantic request/response schemas, unchanged from before.

`app/teacher/` is the reference implementation of this pattern (`repository.py`, `service.py`, `router.py`). Cross-cutting dependencies that need a service (e.g. `get_current_teacher` in `app/core/dependencies.py`) depend on the module's `get_<name>_service`, not on the repository or `AsyncSession` directly.

Domain errors are raised as `AppException` subclasses (`app/core/exceptions.py`) — e.g. `ConflictException`, `AuthenticationException`, `NotFoundException` — never `HTTPException` directly. Each carries `error_code`, `error_status`, `detail` (specific, request-level message), and `message` (generic class-level default); a single handler registered in `app/main.py` serializes all four into the JSON error body. Because FastAPI's own `HTTPBearer` raises a bare `HTTPException` on a missing/malformed `Authorization` header (which would otherwise bypass that handler and return a bare `{"detail": ...}` body), `app/core/dependencies.py` wraps it in a `BearerAuth` subclass that catches and re-raises as `AuthenticationException` — use `BearerAuth`, not `HTTPBearer` directly, anywhere bearer auth is wired up.

## Backend commands

Run from `backend/`, with the venv activated (`source .number-nest-venv/bin/activate`):

- Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run dev server: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
- Apply migrations: `alembic upgrade head`
- Create a migration: `alembic revision -m "..."` (this project hand-writes `upgrade`/`downgrade` bodies rather than relying on `--autogenerate`)

## Frontend commands

Run from `frontend/`:

- Install deps: `npm install`
- Run dev server: `npm run dev`
- Type-check + production build: `npm run build` (runs `tsc -b && vite build`)
- Lint: `npm run lint` (oxlint)

## Deployment

- Both `frontend/` and `backend/` deploy to Render (`frontend` as a static site, `backend` as a
  web service) — the frontend is served from `number-nest-frontend.onrender.com`.
- Render's static-site host only serves files that actually exist in the published directory
  (`dist/`); it doesn't know about client-side routes. Since this is a React Router SPA, a hard
  refresh or direct link to any non-root path (e.g. `/enrollments`) is a real HTTP `GET` to
  Render for that exact path, which 404s unless told otherwise — `index.html` is the one static
  file every route actually resolves to; React Router picks the page to render client-side based
  on the URL once that shell has loaded. Fixed via `frontend/public/_redirects`
  (`/*  /index.html  200`), which Vite copies into `dist/` on build and Render reads
  automatically to rewrite every unmatched path to `index.html` instead of 404ing. This only
  takes effect on a fresh deploy (the rule has to land in a built `dist/`), not by editing the
  file alone.

## Features

1. **Course** — create/manage courses (name, recurring fee, one-time enrollment fee, subject, days, class time, capacity, motto, note); course detail includes the list of enrolled students
2. **Students** — create/manage student records (name, college, contact, email, whatsapp_number); a student's detail page shows their enrollments plus a computed due-payments list and payment history
3. **Enrollment** — add or remove a student from a course, with a `start_from` date, an `enrollment_fee_paid` flag tracking whether that course's enrollment fee has been paid, and a `discontinued_at` date marking when a student stopped the course (add/delete only for the enrollment itself; the fee-paid flag and the discontinued-at date are the two fields updatable in place). A discontinued enrollment drops off the course's enrolled-student roster and stops accruing new due-payment months, but its payment/attendance/mark history stays visible on the student's detail page.
4. **Payment tracking** — manually record payments against a student's course enrollment; no gateway, no automated billing
5. **Attendance** — record attendance per student per course session
6. **Exam** — schedule exams for a course (course, date/time, description, exam mark); add/delete only; its detail page hosts per-student mark entry
7. **Notice** — post event notices tied to a course (event name, place, date/time, course); add/delete only, not tied to individual enrollments
8. **Mark** — record each enrolled student's obtained mark for an exam, bulk-submitted per exam sheet (upserts on resubmit, like attendance)
9. **Teacher** — the single teacher is the sole system user/operator; adds/manages students and courses
10. **Landing page** — the public, unauthenticated home page (route `/`): a card grid of upcoming notices, plus a "Watch your routine" course picker showing that course's day/time schedule as an HTML table; read-only, no login, no detail pages

## Domain notes

- Single teacher only — not multi-tenant, no teacher-course assignment relation. The teacher is the only actor who logs in; students have no login/portal.
- The landing page (`/`) is the one deliberate exception to "every route requires `get_current_teacher`" — it's read-only (courses and upcoming notices only) and exists so visitors can check a course's schedule without an account.
- A student can be enrolled in multiple courses; a course can have multiple students (many-to-many via the enrollment relation).
- Payments, attendance, and marks all hang off the student-course enrollment, not the student or course alone.
- Per-feature details live in `.claude/rules/features/`.
- Keep this file updated as the schema and API surface solidify — add test/lint commands here once they exist, and frontend run/build commands once the frontend has real functionality.
